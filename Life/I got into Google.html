<h1 class="title">I am going to work at an internship in Google</h1>
<p>
I just wanted to make a quick post discussing how I got an offer from Google this summer.
The internship program that I'm going to be part of is called STEP.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org83aae3b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org83aae3b">How much and what did I study?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org83aae3b">
<p>
So normally people tend to study a lot for this kind of interviews. I have discussed this with
some of my friends and the popular advice online is to roughly study around a month and grind
on a lot on problems from Leetcode.
</p>

<p>
The only problem was, that I did not have a lot of time. I basically got the offer to do the
interview go directly into my spam, so I had to device a plan and go through all of the Leetcode
grind in less than a week.

<h2 id="orgc66b352">So what did I do?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc66b352">
<p>
I ended up studying roughly three to four hours a day through a series of the classical algorithms
and compressing on some information.
</p>

<p>
The following is a table of all of the things that I studied before the interview:

<h2 id="org7379ec7">Some thoughts after the interview</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7379ec7">
<p>
I didn't think that the interviewers were really harsh. On the contrary, they were really cheering
me to program my ideas. And the problems were not impossible compared to some of the horror stories
of impossible problems I heard.

<h2 id="orgac1e8b8">Really excited for the future</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgac1e8b8">
<p>
In conclusion I think I'm really excited for the future and I will make another entry
when I end the internship. For now I think I am really excited to learn.
