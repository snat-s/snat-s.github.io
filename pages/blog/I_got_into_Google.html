    <h1 class="title">I am going to work at an internship in Google</h1>
    <p>I just wanted to make a quick post discussing how I got an offer from Google this summer.
      The internship program that I'm going to be part of is called STEP.</p>

    <h2>How much and what did I study?</h2>
    <p> So normally people tend to study a lot for this kind of interviews. I have discussed this with
      some of my friends and the popular advice online is to roughly study around a month and grind
      on a lot on problems from Leetcode.</p>

    <p>The only problem was, that I did not have a lot of time. I basically got the offer to do the
      interview go directly into my spam, so I had to device a plan and go through all of the Leetcode
      grind in less than a week.</p>

    <h2>So what did I do?</h2>
    <p> I ended up studying roughly three to four hours a day through a series of the classical algorithms
      and compressing on some information.</p>

    <p>The following is a table of all of the things that I studied before the interview:</p>

    <table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


      <colgroup>
        <col  class="org-left" />

        <col  class="org-left" />

        <col  class="org-left" />

        <col  class="org-left" />
      </colgroup>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th scope="col" class="org-left">Day 1</th>
          <th scope="col" class="org-left">Day 2</th>
          <th scope="col" class="org-left">Day 3</th>
          <th scope="col" class="org-left">Interview Day</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td class="org-left">Create a Stack from scratch</td>
          <td class="org-left">Quick Sort</td>
          <td class="org-left">Trees (Implement a binary tree and BST)</td>
          <td class="org-left">Not stress  and  wait for the best</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td class="org-left">Merge Sort</td>
          <td class="org-left">Trees (find height of a tree and simmetry)</td>
          <td class="org-left">Prep interview with a friend</td>
          <td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td class="org-left">Create a Queue from scratch</td>
          <td class="org-left">Prep interview with a friend</td>
          <td class="org-left">Create a Linked List from scratch</td>
          <td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td class="org-left">Tree Traversal: inorder, preorder, postorder and BFS</td>
          <td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
          <td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
          <td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Some thoughts after the interview</h2>
    <p>
      I didn't think that the interviewers were really harsh. On the contrary, they were really cheering
      me to program my ideas. And the problems were not impossible compared to some of the horror stories
      of impossible problems I heard.
    </p>

    <h2>Really excited for the future</h2>
    <p>
      In conclusion I think I'm really excited for the future and I will make another entry
      when I end the internship. For now I think I am really excited to learn.
